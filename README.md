## Description

> [!NOTE]
> Alternative attmepts and experimentation for the GA and cost function can be found in the unmerged branches.

This respository contains all the relevant code developed for Group 1's submission. A Genetic Algorithm and complementary cost function have been developed as per the project specifications.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure that you have installed the relevant imports:\
> `# pip install imageio matplotlib scikit-learn scipy sympy`\
> and are running the jupyter notebook on Python version 3.12.2.

To test the developed Genetic Algorithm and cost function simply run all cells within the [OurCamoWorm.ipynb](OurCamoWorm.ipynb) file and review the final clew outputted at the end of the notebook.
