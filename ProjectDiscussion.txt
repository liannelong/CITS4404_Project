General Project Notes:

Discussion with Cara:
    Returning the best clew that you can find.
    The weight that you are selecting for the cost function is going to determine 
    how your algorithm is going value different candidates.

    Can build an attention mechanism to focus on areas with more detail? 


General Interpretation of the Project:

    The overall goal of the project is to use an evolutionary algorithm to generate
    solutions (instances of the clews on the image), for each clew we evalaute them using
    the fitness/cost function, this considers the weights.

    Weights are based on the 8 properties of the worms, so their location (2 params),
    size and orientation (2 params), curvature (2 params), width (1 param) and colour (1 param).

    We choose how the weights are evaluated.

    Optimisation of the algorithm is the main purpose?

    Stick with genetic algorithm.

    1. We have a genetic algorithm implementation
        - Create a population of clews.
        We know a couple of things:
        - information about each worm
        - information about how each worm exists in relation to each other.
        - information about the image
    2. We use our cost function select what's correct or not
        take all the information about the worms
    3. Correct ones are used with crossover or mutation ect to form the next population
    4. when we reach an overall fitness then we return the best clew? 

    Requirements for the worms:
    - Areas little change in intensity have big worms
    - ...
